# Xiaozhi Universal Relay - Multi-LLM Bridge

A modular Node.js relay that implements the **[Xiaozhi Protocol](https://github.com/78/xiaozhi-esp32)**, bridging hardware devices (like ESP32 smartwatches and AI assistants) with various LLM backends including **Google Gemini**, **Alibaba Qwen**, and local **LFM (Liquid Foundation Models)** based on **[llama.cpp LFM2.5-Audio](https://github.com/tdakhran/llama.cpp/tree/tarek/feat/os-lfm2.5-audio-1.5b-upstream)**.

## Features
- **Xiaozhi Protocol Support**: Fully compatible with Xiaozhi "hello" handshakes, state management (stt, tts, abort), and binary audio transport.
- **Universal Modular Architecture**: Built on a highly modular `LLMProvider` adapter pattern. The server starts even if no providers are configured, allowing you to manage everything via the web dashboard.
- **Supported Backends**:
  - **Google Gemini Live**: Full real-time streaming with MCP Tool calling support.
  - **Alibaba Qwen (Omni & Realtime)**: Support for `qwen3-omni-flash` with full **MCP Tool calling** and `qwen3-omni-flash-realtime` for ultra-low latency.
  - **Local LFM / Llama**: Support for local model servers (e.g., Llama Liquid) with both sequential and native interleaved audio support. *Note: MCP tool call support for LFM is currently in development.*
- **Dynamic Configuration Dashboard**: Choose between backends, models, and custom voices per-device. The UI automatically labels and disables providers that are missing required API keys or environment variables.
- **Built-in Dashboard MCP**: Control the server itself by talking to the AI! Approve new devices and change configurations via voice commands.
- **Real-time Transcoding**: Converts 16kHz Opus from devices to PCM, and transcodes LLM PCM responses back to 60ms Opus frames.
- **Low Latency**: Direct WebSocket piping for minimal delay.
- **Secure**: Features per-device dynamic tokens and max-pending rate limits for anti-spam.

## How it Works
1.  **Handshake**: The Xiaozhi device connects and sends a `{"type": "hello", ...}` JSON message.
2.  **Session Initiation**: The relay validates the token and instantiates the configured `LLMProvider`. If a provider is selected but not configured (e.g., missing API key), the device receives a graceful error message.
3.  **Voice Interaction**: 
    - Device sends 16kHz Opus -> Relay decodes to PCM -> LLM Provider processes (using Server VAD or custom Energy VAD).
    - LLM speaks PCM -> Relay encodes to 24kHz Opus -> Device plays.
    - If supported by the model, the Relay routes **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** tool calls to connected devices.
4.  **Feedback**: Relay sends STT and TTS text updates back to the device for display.

## Authentication & Security

The server features a multi-layered authentication system:
- **Xiaozhi Devices**: Automatically assigned unique tokens upon first discovery via the OTA endpoint.
- **MCP Devices**: Support for "Bring Your Own Token" to lock specific device IDs.
- **Anti-Spam**: Strict limits on pending unapproved devices to prevent DOS attacks.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Installation
```bash
cd xiaozhi-server-nodejs
npm install
```

### 2. Configuration
Copy the `.env.example` file and fill in your keys:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Available providers will depend on which environment variables (e.g., `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY`, `LIQUID_SERVER_URL`) are populated.

### 3. Local Development
For local testing (Ubuntu, Raspberry Pi, etc.), use the `.env.example.local` template and ensure you use your machine's local IP address instead of `localhost`.

### 4. Running the Server
```bash
node app.js
```
Access the dashboard at `http://YOUR_IP:3000`.

## Technical Details
- **Audio Input**: 16kHz, Mono, Opus.
- **Audio Output**: 24kHz, Mono, Opus (60ms frames).

## Logs
Logs are automatically rotated and stored as `connection-YYYY-MM-DD.log`, tracking OTA requests, WebSocket handshakes, and LLM session lifecycles.

## Limitations
- Only implements the WebSocket protocol; the MQTT endpoint is a placeholder.
- Tool calling (MCP) is currently supported for Gemini and Qwen Omni; LFM support is pending.
